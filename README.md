## Project Journey
This project was developed over a three-month period, involving:

* Complete design in Onshape with multiple design iterations
* Extensive 3D printing and refinement phases
* Months of software development for autonomous operation

## Hardware Components
* Tower Pro MG996R servo motors for all joints
* Raspberry Pi as the main controller
* PCA9685 PWM controller board for servo control
* Custom 3D printed parts using PLA/PETG

## Software
The robotic arm can be controlled through various methods:

* Core programming in Python
* Alternative C++ implementation available
* Multiple control interfaces:
  * 3D model-based control
  * Xbox/PlayStation controller support
  * Voice command recognition (in development)

## Features
* Full 6-degree freedom of movement
* Independent operation capability
* Precision movement and positioning
* Expandable functionality through software

## Coming Soon
* Hand-like end effector to replace the current two-finger gripper
* Enhanced control interfaces for more intuitive operation
* Expanded task automation capabilities

## Project Goals
The main objective is to create an accessible, versatile robotic arm that can be placed on anyone's desk at home, capable of performing a variety of practical tasks while being affordable and easy to replicate.

## Build Instructions
Detailed build instructions, including parts list, assembly guide, and software setup will be provided in the documentation folder.
