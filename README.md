## Project Journey
This project was developed over a three-month period, involving:

* Complete design in Onshape with multiple design iterations
* Extensive 3D printing and refinement phases
* Months of software development for autonomous operation

## Hardware Components
* Tower Pro MG996R servo motors for all joints
* Raspberry Pi as the main controller
* PCA9685 PWM controller board for servo control
* Custom 3D printed parts using PLA/PETG
